# Simple To-do List app
This app was created with starter code that was provided in my MIT xPro MERN stack development course

## How to run

I suggest downloading all the files and running on an http-server

### ROAD MAP
I would like to add an 'undo' function as well as a button that will display completed or removed tasks with date and timestamps
